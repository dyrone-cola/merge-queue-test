# Trace2 Receiver

The `trace2receiver` project is a
[trace receiver](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/trace-receiver/)
component library for an
[OpenTelemetry Custom Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/)
daemon.  It receives
[Git Trace2](https://git-scm.com/docs/api-trace2#_the_event_format_target)
telemetry from local Git commands, translates it into an OpenTelemetry
format, and forwards it to other OpenTelemetry components.

This component is useful it you want to collect performance data for
Git commands, aggregate data from multiple users to create performance
dashboards, build distributed traces of nested Git commands, or
understand how the size and shape of your Git repositories affect
command performance.


## Background

This project is a GOLANG static library component that must be linked
into an OpenTelemetry Custom Collector along with other pipeline and
exporter components to process and forward the telemetry data to a
data store, such as Azure Monitor or another
[OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/)
aware cloud provider.

Setup and configuration details are provided in the
[Docs](./Docs/README.md).


The [sample-trace2-otel-collector](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/sample-trace2-otel-collector)
peer repository contains a pre-built open source sample collector to help you get started.  See the
README for more details.
